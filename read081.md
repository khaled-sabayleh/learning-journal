# Introducing How Computers Work
we have the four main component elements :
input 
output
cpu 
memory
the main think we should to know is how the computer works ?

# What Makes a Computer, a Computer ?
we have the four common to all computers :
input
storage
processing
output

the  input : we have many elemint use it to input information to the storage of the computer like mouse / keypoord /camera ...etc


storage and processing : all the information input go to the storage memory and the processor tacke it to mainpulates it or change it using an algorithm .

# Binary number system
Computers work on (Ones and zeros)
Inside computers,there are electric wires and circuits that carry information
In order to process information that comes as input and to make it output, computer needs to modify and combine the input signal

Milling machines are using to create 3D objects

To display each letter,a computer runs thousands of instructions

The cpu is the master chip that controls all parts of computer
