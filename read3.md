# Prerequisites
*Before beginning this tutorial, it is highly recommended that you have a solid understanding of the Terminal (for Mac) or Command Line (for Windows and Linux).*

In order to explain Git, we have to first explain various aspects of Version Control.


# Version Control
1. local version control
2. centralized version control
3. distriputed version control


# So, what is Git?
Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

# important notes about git:***
history of change of your life
ability to view apply and remove
let multiple develpers work on the same code
when you did a huge change you have to commit it to not lose any change
git keep track of what the file looked like at diffrent points of time
each commite has a label like: head which mean “are you here”
you can assign message to commit
