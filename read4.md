# Process & Design html

Who is the Site For?
Every website should be designed for the
target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.

# Why People Visit YOUR Website .
firstly for motivation and for specific goals.

  # Extra Markup
Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of  HTML
the page is using (although
browsers usually display the
page even if it is not included).
We will therefore be including
one in each example for the rest
of the book




Grouping Text &
Elements In a Block :

 The <div> element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.
For example, you might create
a <div> element to contain all
of the elements for the header
of your site (the logo and the
navigation), or you might create
a <div> element to contain
comments from visitors.
In a browser, the contents of
the <div> element will start on
a new line, but other than this
it will make no difference to the
presentation of the page.
Using an id or class attribute
on the <div> element, however,
means that you can create
CSS style rules to indicate how
much space the <div> element
should occupy on the screen and
change the appearance of all the
elements contained within it.
It can also make it easier to
follow your code if you have used
<div> elements to hold each
section of the pag .
